# Changelog

- Bootstrapped a new Flutter app inside the existing `c3_creatorclub` repository; configured iOS/Android bundle IDs; integrated Firebase via FlutterFire; generated `lib/firebase_options.dart`; installed `firebase_core`; implemented init screen showing project/app IDs; added `.gitignore` and pushed to GitHub. (Notes: CI draft not included; iOS CocoaPods installed and bundle ID set; Android `applicationId` updated.)
- Implemented design system theming with `AppTheme` using brand colors (Primary #3533CD, Dark Gray #363433, White #FFFFFF); wired into `MaterialApp`; styled AppBar, Buttons, Inputs, Dividers, Cards, Chips. Replaced seed theme with explicit `AppTheme.light()`/`dark()`.
- Added Garet fonts to `assets/fonts/` and registered in `pubspec.yaml`; typography across light/dark uses `Garet`.
- Added `flutter_riverpod` and `go_router`; created `lib/app.dart` (`C3App`) with `MaterialApp.router`; added `core/router/app_router.dart` and basic route to Firebase check; updated `main.dart` to use `ProviderScope`; fixed widget test after `MyApp` removal.
- Added codegen stack (macros): pinned `freezed_annotation 3.1.0`, `freezed`, `json_annotation`, `json_serializable`, `build_runner`; added `UserProfile` model (`lib/data/models/user_profile.dart`) with PRD fields and `fromJson`. (Notes: Using Dart macros; no generated files committed.)
- Added `firebase_auth` and `cloud_firestore` (aligned with `firebase_core` 3.15.2); built `auth_repository.dart` with auth state provider, user profile stream, and sign-in/out helpers; added `SignInScreen` and `ProfileScreen`; router guards redirect unauthenticated to `/signin` and authenticated to `/profile`; `app.dart` now reads router from `routerProvider`; updated tests to expect Sign In when unauthenticated.
- Extended registration: profession selector; avatar upload to Firebase Storage with photoUrl persisted; `UserProfile` includes `profession`; profile shows avatar and profession; refined register form integrated with repository; analyzer/tests green.
- Added Profile Edit screen (`/profile/edit`) to edit name, phone, profession, niche, and avatar; route and AppBar action wired; flows refined to match PRD.
- Added `firebase_storage`, `image_picker`, `cached_network_image`; created `storage_repository.dart`; implemented email/password register + sign-in with Firestore profile creation; added `/register` route; kept analyzer/tests green. (Notes: earlier macro alignment impacted profession; later restored.)
- Added MVP shell with bottom NavigationBar (`HomeShell`) and routes `/rooms`, `/chat`, `/profile`; placeholder screens for Rooms, Chat, My Bookings, Membership; simple `isPremiumProvider` for premium checks; router migrated to `ShellRoute` and redirects signed-in users to `/rooms`.
- UI widgets: `MembershipBadge`, `UserAvatar`, `SectionHeader`, `RoomCard`, `SlotGrid`; Rooms list shows sample RoomCards and navigates to `RoomDetailScreen` preview. (Notes: Chat premium gating stubbed for now.)
- Added Room domain model (`Room` via Freezed/JSON) and `RoomsRepository` with `roomsProvider` stream; enhanced `RoomCard` (photos, location, capacity, facilities, price, rating); `RoomDetailScreen` initially showed hours, facilities, description, and SlotGrid; `RoomsListScreen` consumes provider with sample fallback when Firestore is empty. (Notes: codegen via macros may output 0 files but analyzer compiles.)
- Infra: added `firestore.rules` allowing public read of `/rooms/*` and self read/write for `/users/{uid}`; updated README with rules deployment and manual seeding instructions for `rooms`.
- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project conventions, Freezed migration notes, and references to PRD and Design Guidelines.
- Redesigned `RoomDetailScreen` with a modern layout: photo carousel with rounded corners, info chips (location, capacity, hours), amenities grid with icons, TableCalendar date selector, SlotGrid bound to the room’s open hours, and a footer with price and “Book Now” CTA; converted screen to `StatefulWidget`, cleaned duplicate imports, and kept analyzer green. Also added the `table_calendar` dependency.
